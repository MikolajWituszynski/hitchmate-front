[2011-09-01 01:12:24]<hr>You need some time to get there with public transportation, but there's plenty of car.

I would have been happy to even get to Dresden, but they took me 500km with 200km\/h in my precise direction :D [2014-05-03 23:14:43]<hr>20 minutes with a Berlin sign gave no result, I decided to make a new one saying just Germany. In this process a guy asked me where I was heading to and offered me a lift to Usti nad Labem. Not a bad spot. \nFemale, solo, working day, noon. [2014-07-05 19:50:25]<hr>Quite crowded in nice summer days, there were about 7 other hitchhikers so we moved to the ramp 500 m behind (nice place but no long distance traffic) and quickly got lift to Agip next to ÃšstÃ­ nad Labem. [2014-07-26 13:52:47]<hr>Stood here in the early morning for 30 minutes, than a Hungarian truck driver took me near to Berlin. I reached this spot from Strizkov metro station by walk, which wasnt a small one, but you just have to walk next to road LibereckÃ¡, than cross the junction  go offroad through the field and voilÃ¡... here you are! :) The jungle-trip worth its price.\n [2014-07-26 14:23:10]<hr>From metro station LÃ¡dvÃ­ take bus 103 or other bus that goes there. Cross the bridge and you are there. No crossing fields or long marches. Maybe better without a sign and just get to the next station which is definitely more popular.
